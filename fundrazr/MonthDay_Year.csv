270,Help surprise Steve with Enchroma glasses!,U.S. Dollar,"Dec 14, 2017",of $349 goal,5,"Hi everyone! I've been wanting to do this for about a year but
      Steve has always said no because these glasses are too expensive.
      So..... I thought I would get creative and do it this way. Steve is colorblind and I would love to give him the
      ""gift of COLOR""! These glasses are supposed to be
      amazing and with your help, Steve will finally be able to see all
      the colors in the Crayola box lol! (He hates words like
      ""violet"" and ""burnt sienna"" because he has no
      idea what they look like!) Also, he can finally dress himself without asking me
      ""does this match""? Although it's sort of cute to see the
      types of things he pairs together, it's time he literally gets to
      see for himself. The glasses themselves are $349 plus an additional $150 for a
      prescription pair totaling $499. If you would like to be a part of
      this amazing gift, any little bit helps and I know Steve would be
      so touched, and probably embarrassed to know that you donated. His birthday is in December so I'm hoping to give him the
      glasses by Dec 14 or by Christmas. Oh and by the way, I will film
      the whole thing and post his reaction so you all can be a part of
      this amazing experience. He might kill me for doing so but I'm
      doing this because I love him and want to give him the gift of a
      lifetime. I would love for our friends and family to be a part of
      this amazing gift! I am so excited for him!! Thank you!! WHAT IS ENCHROMA? Over 300 million people worldwide are affected by red-green color

  2 when I was 16 years old with hearing and vision damaged. It causes
  tumors to grow anywhere in my brain, along with the spinal cords and
  peripheral nerves. So far I have had 20 different surgeries to safely
  remove the tumors whenever needed to preserve my life. In November 2017, I need to under go surgery again to remove multiple
  large tumors called schwannoma from both my arms. They have made my
  fingers and hands increasingly numb. If they are not carefully
  removed, they can paralyze my arms. I cannot become incapacitated, my mother will be helpless if I loose
  the ability to take care of myself. Last year, I had brain surgery at
  the US NIH, the surgery was done well. However, I was not taken cared
  of well in the ward. My vision became damaged as a result, I have had
  to adapt by getting help from people to do my work and in order to
  stay productive, while my mother started having to prepare my daily
  living needs despite her advanced age.  So I must go for surgery with
  doctors who can do better to save my arms before it is too late. Some brief details about the surgery: Where: St Vincent Medical Center, Los Angeles. By Who: Dr. Gregory P Lekovic, Neurosurgeon.

"15,469",Ride to Give- Flash Ironman Fundraiser for Stephen,U.S. Dollar,,of $15k goal,921,"On Sunday, September 24th Team Ride to Give and Team Boom will be participating in Ironman 70.3 Augusta in Augusta , GA Kevin Baxter 1130 Austin Marshall 101 Bill Halstead 102 Stacy Hughes Halstead Team Boom 4019 Larry Daniel Hughes Team Boom 4019 Crystal Condon Team Boom - 4019 David Nazaroff Ride To Give 3.0 4065 Sarah J. Keeney Ride To Give 3.0 4065 Kelly Meredith Ride To Give 3.0 4065 George Abrams 1108 Erik and Patty Heine of Oklahoma City, OK were excited to welcome
  their first child, a son Stephen, in 2007. After he was born, the
  Heines observed Stephen had broad thumbs and toes, which they found
  odd but endearing. He also had a LOT of hair! From birth, Stephen
  struggled with feeding which caused him to have trouble gaining
  weight. It was frustrating, but they chalked it up to reflux and enjoy
  their sweet new baby. As he grew, Stephen hit his milestones on time, but always at the
  late end of the ""normal"" range. When Stephen was nine months
  old, he had hernia surgery, which led to the discovery of a heart
  murmur and a kidney abnormality. Following surgery, Stephen's physical
  development stalled, and at one year old, he was referred for Early
  Intervention for therapies. There were still lingering
    questions about his health issues, and after additional testing,
    Stephen was diagnosed with Rubinstein Taybi Syndrome in
    May of 2008. Rubinstein Taybi Syndrome , a
  genetic disorder which affects approximately 1:250,000 births, is
  characterized by short stature, moderate to severe intellectual
  disability, distinctive facial features, and broad thumbs and first
  toes. Additional features of the disorder can include eye
  abnormalities, heart and kidney defects, dental problems, and obesity.
  These signs and symptoms vary among affected individuals. People with
  this condition have an increased risk of developing noncancerous and
  cancerous tumors, including certain kinds of brain tumors. Cancer of
  blood-forming tissue (leukemia) also occurs more frequently in people
  with Rubinstein Taybi syndrome. Infants born with this severe form of
  the disorder usually survive only into early childhood. Thankfully Stephen’s overall health has balanced out, and he
    is a happy and thriving 4th grader. Currently, Stephen receives private physical and occupational
  therapies, as well as physical, occupational, and speech therapy in
  his school setting.  To meet his goals of independence as an adult,
  Stephen spends approximately 3/4 of his school day with his typically
  developing peers, in the regular education classroom. Also, he has
  difficulty communicating verbally, so he uses Proloquo2Go software on an iPad
  mini to communicate. Doctors have not given the Heines a timeline as to what they should
  expect with Stephen, so they take everything one day at a time.
  They're determined to not let their child's disability or illness keep
  them from doing the things they love and find a way to adapt and make
  that activity possible. Erik is an avid runner, and for years it has
  been an activity he can share with Stephen. Up until recently, they
  have been able to use a traditional running stroller which Stephen has
  now out grown and is not 100% safe for him. After much research, Eric
  found the Blade at www.hoytrunningchairs.com . Hoyt Running Chairs designs and
    manufactures state-of-the-art racing chairs for individuals with
    disabilities. As a subdivision of Southbridge Tool &
    Manufacturing , they are able to custom build each chair to the
    comfort and needs of both the rider and the runner. They pride
    themselves on getting to know their clients and providing them with
    the ultimate racing experience. Mike Didonato , the president of Southbridge
    Tool & Manufacturing first heard the story of Rick and Dick Hoyt in 2009. Dick Hoyt has pushed his son Rick,
      who was diagnosed a spastic quadriplegic with cerebral palsy after
      his birth in 1962, in over 1,000 races including marathons,
      triathlons, and 6 Ironman races. Their story inspired Mike,
    and a few months later he happened to meet Dick Hoyt at a local
    grocery store. Mike mentioned his family’s manufacturing company and
    offered to fix Rick’s chair if needed. The next year, Dick Hoyt
    showed up at Southbridge Tool and Manufacturing and asked if a brand
    new chair could be built for Rick because he was very uncomfortable
    in his original chair. The Signature was built in time for the Hoyts to compete in the 2010 Boston Marathon . The chair was
    beautifully built for comfort, speed, and maneuverability. Soon,
    other teams and families began asking for a chair. In 2014, Mike was
    approached by Nick Sotar , a retired bicycle shop owner, who
    admired The Signature but had some ideas to improve the design. Nick
    presented Mike with a design for a revolutionary new racing chair
    called The Blade , which is easily
    disassembled and can be shipped in a bike box. After Stephen was diagnosed with Rubinstein Taybi syndrome at 18
  months old, it took almost seven years before they were able to get
  him on non-income-based Medicaid. As a result, the Heines ate through
  their entire family savings paying for medical bills and therapies
  even with insurance. Unfortunately, the cost of a Blade racing
    wheelchair is approximately 10% of Erik’s gross annual
  salary as a Professor of Music at Oklahoma City University ,
  and not something they have sitting around or in a savings account.
  The Blade has not been deemed ""essential"" by their
  insurance. However, Stephen's Occupational and Physical Therapists
  both believe that a chair that he can use for over a decade IS
  essential to helping him relieve stress and participate in an outdoor
  activity like his typically-developing peers. Ride to Give agrees and wants to provide Stephen with a custom
    built Blade that will fit him perfectly and will be used for years
    to come. Our mission at RTG is to turn athletic ability into
  fundraising power for families with children who are disabled,
  injured, or ill.  We think Stephen and Erik will make fantastic
  ambassadors for Team Ride to Give and we can’t wait to see them race
  for the first time with their new Hoyt Running Chair . Please help us purchase the
  Blade running chair and accessories for Stephen by making a tax
  deductible donation to Ride to Give. At this time, Stephen does not have a Facebook Page of his
    own, so follow Ride to GIve on Facebook for all updates. Contributions are solicited with the understanding that the
      donee organization (Ride to Give, 501c3 tax ID 46-2952297) has complete discretion and control over the use of all donated funds.

"1,445",Merrick's Battle Continues Until He Wins..........,,,,,"Our 14yo son Merrick was diagnosed in December 2014 with
  Medulloblastoma, a cancer in the cerebellum of the brain.  Surgery
  removed a third of the tumor and allowed for testing which identified
  the cancer as a more difficult to treat and more likely to recur
  type.  After 8 months of intensive treatment involving Radiation and
  Chemotherapy he enjoyed 10 months cancer free.  In August of 2016, his
  MRI showed recurrence in a new area of the cerebellum.  Our next plan
  of attack started in September of 2016 with treatment called Memmat. 
  That treatment involved injecting chemotherapy directly into his head
  via an Ommaya reservoir that would circulate it around the brain and
  into the spine.  He also took a variety of chemo medications orally. 
  This treatment worked until July of  2017 when progression and new
  tumors were discovered.  We began yet another therapy mid July 2017. 
  He had 3 surgeries from mid July to early August to deal with a CSF
  leak in his head.  He started round 3 of antibody treatment at MUSC on
  August 29th and will begin yet another chemotherapy drug.  Next scans
  are mid September 2017 to check his status.  We continue to fight and
  appreciate all your prayers, well wishes and assistance in every way.

230,WE NEED YOU AGAIN! Gov not responding to us at all,U.S. Dollar,"Nov 15, 2017",of $3k goal,4,"Hi All! Most of you know that we have
      had a rough year in terms of work, medical procedures, lack of
      work and more procedures. Ethan finally went in and made
      it out of the heel cord surgery we've been anticipating for months. We found out that Ethan has an
      incredibly high arch and Dr. Dow said there is a chance that he
      will need more surgery. Right now, Ethan is not allowed
      to put any weight on his feet at all, meaning, I must stay home
      with him 24/7 in case of fire or emergency. I have to bathe him,
      help him use the restroom, dress him, feed him, and administer his
      medication, all while still attending online courses. I applied for SSI for Ethan
      over 3 months ago. I have received no response and cannot get
      through to the office. I have written to Senator Tim
      Scott, asking for any information that would point me in the right
      direction for any grants or funding that our particular situation
      could be eligible for. I have also written to the White House with
      the same questions. The only thing I have
      accomplished by reaching out to local, state and fed. gov. is that
      now my email is bombarded with stories of why ""this
      person"" is working for the people, etc... No one from the government (on
      any level) has even acknowledged our concerns, much less responded
      with any sort of advice on where to look. I am a single mom. My son has
      Aspergers. My son makes straight As. I currently have a 4.0 and I
      am actively taking college courses. Ethan's father has never paid
      child support and I cannot pursue him for financial assistance
      since he is not a US citizen. There must be something we are
      eligible for??!! One would think, right? Well, I have yet to find anything. I have always worked. I have
      always been Ethan's provider with the help from immediate family
      when really needed. Ethan does have Medicaid and we
      finally received food stamps. But what of rent? Utilities?
      Toiletries? School supplies? Anything that we cannot eat? It is not anyone's
      responsibility, and I absolutely hate that this is the place I
      have to turn AGAIN since I am not eligible for help since
      I am physically capable of working. Apparently, our situation falls
      in some grey area and no one can really give me an answer on how I
      can find help. If anyone knows of someone who
      can help us find these answers, Please let me know, as I am out of ideas. Once again, We thank you and
      love you so much for all of your continued support and, once more,
      I would never ask unless absolutely urgent and necessary. Thank you all... again. Please share, as the more who
      know, the better chance we can find some answers. Love, Steph and Ethan PS. Ethan is feeling much
      better and is taking this all so well, considering! He is an

  improverished children. We cover our own travel and all associated
  expenses. We are asking you to help us raise funds for this school so
  that the children can obtain medical care at local clinics and
  hospitals. We continue to work with a local clinc and strengthen those
  ties. All funds go directly towards the cost of medical care. In 2016 fundraiser we raised $7,745.00, $1,235 more than the
  goal! The projected expenses for  medical care (including
  hospitalization, consults, labs, x-rays, scans, medicines,
  transportation, etc) for 2017 equates to $789.31 per month or $9471.73
  for the whole year. After we deducted the $1,235 ""excess"" we
  raised last year, the total goal for 2017 is $8,400. This puts us just past the financial goal. The reason for the increase in the budget this year is: The Quetzal has strengthened substantially compared to the
      USD, previously it was 7.75/1, now it is down to 7.3/1. Over the last year we have increased our numbers to 679
      students across the Foundation. On November 18, 2017 we are hosting a fundraiser at the Yakima Sports
  Center. We will be sharing our stories while hosting a silent auction,
  having a split the pot or 50/50 (winner took home almost $200 last
  year!) and games. Please help us with this fundraiser that will enable
  hundreds of impoverished children obtain access to healthcare. We support children and their future. People (specifically children)
  are the best investment. In order to improve a population you need
  empowerment and independence. The proven form has been education.
  These children face countless socioeconomic and psychological
  barriers. A holistic approach is required to improve longterm
  outcomes. What these children face on a near daily basis makes all of
  our life obstacles seem pity. The staff and volunteers provide long
  term commitment. They genuinely care and love the community in which
  they are empowering. They sacrifice so much for others. This is a long
  term and sustainable commitment. They aren't going anywhere unless
  these socioeconomic issues are resolved. If you are able, please help us and help spread the word. Any
  donation is greatly appreciated. These children are combating extreme
  poverty and many face inhuman conditions. This school provides a safe

  for the majority of Bob’s life, surfaced with a vengeance. This disease has exacted a terrible toll on Bob. The first thing that Parkinson’s took from Bob was his ability to
  make music with his guitar.   The loss of that light within the world
  has been immeasurable; anyone who has spent any time with Bob knows
  that a guitar in his hands is like a painter with fresh watercolors,
  staring at a beautiful vista… His ability to make that instrument sing
  shaped the majority of my childhood, and it was a shock to everyone
  around him when he couldn’t play anymore. But Bob persevered. The next thing that Parkinson’s took from Bob was his ability to
  drive and speak publicly. Everyone was taken by surprise at how Bob’s
  Parkinson’s advanced so quickly, and in such a degenerative manner. 
  Nonetheless, with the help of a few friends, family, and Ms. Sandy
  Howell, Bob was able to continue. Bob persevered. Despite all efforts to the contrary, things have gotten worse for
  Bob.  As a result, he now requires round-the-clock, live-in caregivers
  who assist him in all regular daily functions.  The financial
  assistance that is available to him through normal channels just is
  not at all sufficient to cover his medical and care costs.  He is
  desperate need of additional funding, and he has no means to procure
  it for himself.   He has had some additional help from a kind
  benefactor, but this major portion of his funding is going to come to
  an end, soon. So—the question becomes:  does anyone out there want to help out
  Bob?  He needs your help in order to persevere further.  He is working
  with therapists and doctors, and doing his best throughout all of
  these trials and tribulations.  Will you stand with him?  Can you? He doesn’t want to be in the position where he needs to ask for
  help.  Unfortunately, it’s gotten to the point of him actually needing
  to do so in order to survive.  I know it’s a lot to ask for in this
  day and age; we all have our issues and problems.  Trouble doesn’t
  discriminate, as I’m sure we all know. But Bob needs some help.  Please do what you can.  Let’s help Bob
  persevere further.   On his behalf, I thank each and every one of you
  for your time.  C’mon, let’s do this!",https://fundrazr.com/adLI0
"436,857",British Gut,,,,,"This is a unique open collaboration between the TwinsUK team at King's College London and The
      American Gut Project (AGP) to try to understand the bacterial
    diversity of the British Gut . *Notice: We are experiencing some delays with kit turnover, so
    please allow 2-3 weeks for your kit to arrive.* Many people don't realize that the bacteria that live inside us play
  an incredibly important role in our health. There are so many of them,
  that they make up 90 percent of the cells in our body and their most
  important jobs include manufacturing vitamins for us and breaking down
  and digesting our food. The trillions of bacteria in our gut weigh
  nearly 2 kg (over 4lbs). This community of bacteria can be thought of
  as an extra 'organ' which we call our ""microbiome"". We
  evolved together with our microbiome over millions of years. Recent
  research has discovered that small changes in this finely balanced
  community can affect our immune system, metabolism, body weight, mood
  and may even cause diseases such as Crohn's disease, irritable bowel
  syndrome, cancer, autoimmune disease, diabetes and heart disease. This is the first project of its kind in Europe and, with your help,
  we will be able to discover more about the crucial relationship
  between our health and our microbiome, and on a personal level, you
  will be able to discover the bacterial profile of your own gut. With
  your help, we hope to be able to answer questions such as 'How much
  does our choice of lifestyle and diet influence our microbiome, and
  can we alter our microbiome to make us healthier?' We are discovering that each person is very different and has their
  own unique microbiome. More research is needed to work out what
  constitutes a 'healthy' microbiome, and which combinations of bacteria
  should try and be avoided. In order to do this ambitious and
  much-needed project, we urgently need a large scale collection of
  human samples. Over 7 thousand people have already signed up in
  America already- but we need many more from UK Europe. The project mainly focuses on the gut as this is our main 'microbial
  home', however, the study will also look at oral, skin and (for women)
  vaginal communities as these areas of the body have problems such as
  tooth decay, gum disease, acne and infertility and may be influenced
  by the microbiome. What does it entail? First you need to sign up (see Perks on the right) and select your
  level of contribution to the project. Within two weeks, you will
  receive a kit in the mail together with detailed instructions on how
  to proceed. Shipping within the UK first class should be around £2.90,
  but we recommend taking the sample to the post office to get the
  proper postage. Getting the postage right on the first try is
  important since samples that spend a long time in transit will likely
  not produce the highest quality results. After you have returned your
  sample to us, the samples will be processed and analysed by the Knight
  Lab at University of California, San Diego and you will be provided
  with a list of the major groups of bacteria in your sample and the
  proportions in which they are found. We estimate that this will take
  around 3 months (but possibly longer) and once we provide you with
  your results, you will be able to see how your bacterial community
  compares to others in the study. From the diet and lifestyle
  information that you provide, we will also be able to show you how
  your results compare to other people who are within the same diet and
  lifestyle group as you (but having a very different result to them
  does not necessarily mean anything bad, it can just be that you have
  experienced slight lifestyle differences that mean that your bacterial
  profile is different). Please note that this is a scientific study, not a clinical or
      commercial project, and we will not be able to provide you with
      any clinical information related to your microbiome profile. How will my sample be used? The British Gut project, like the American model, gives participants
  the opportunity to compare their personal microbiome profiles to
  family members, and other people both in the UK and abroad. Our
  project is based on the principles of 'access to all'. The data
  collected from the sample you provide will be shared anonymously both
  with participants and scientists, allowing many different scientific
  hypotheses and questions to be answered using your valuable sample. We look forward to working together on this new and exciting project.

"7,590",Please help us fund Michelle's Heart Transplant,Canadian Dollar,"Jul 1, 2018",of $30k goal,49,"Do you know Michelle, like I know Michelle? I first met Michelle
  almost 8 years ago when we were taking a course together. We became
  fast friends as we shared a love of family, food and life. Her
  positive and caring spirit along with her amazing sense of humor have
  always inspired me. She has made a career as an incredibly talented
  Stylist and has shared her passion with a great many colleagues and
  students over the past 23 years. Just over a year ago, upon returning home from a business trip to
  California, Michelle started experiencing minor symptoms of not
  feeling well and knew that something was off. There is no way any of
  us could have predicted what would follow. It turned out that Michelle
  was in Congestive Heart Failure and was taken by Air Ambulance out of
  Williams Lake so that further diagnostic tests could be performed. Her
  husband Jamie was working out in the middle of the Chilcoltin and it
  was uncertain if we would be able to contact him. By the efforts of an
  amazing friend, he was reached and given the shocking news that his
  wife was in Cardiac Failure. The results of these early test had her
  referred to much more specialized Doctors in Vancouver at St. Paul's
  Hospital. She was admitted to hospital to undergo more specialized and
  invasive tests and underwent surgery to implant a Cardiac
  Defibrillator. Immediately prior to discharge Michelle was informed
  that she would need to have a Heart Transplant and that she would need
  to be on a regimen of extensive medications and dietary restrictions
  to stabilize her heart while we waited for transplant. This was
  shocking news to say the least. Michelle had been tested from an early
  age on a regular basis because a heart condition ran in her family.
  Her older brother died of a sudden cardiac event at age 15 in 1982 and
  her Father in January of 1990. No cardiac symptoms presented in
  Michelle and by age 32 she figured that she didn't have the genetic
  defect, and like so many others, found herself without a Family
  Physician so did not undergo further cardiac testing for over a decade. Michelle has not been able to work since May of 2016 and has had to
  travel to Vancouver from Williams Lake several times over the last
  year to see the team of Transplant Doctors. With becoming a single
  income household, she is anxious as to how to pay for the upcoming
  expenses that will be incurred for Transplant, a burden she does not
  want to leave to her Husband, Jamie, to figure out. Recently Michelle and Jamie were evacuated from their home due to the
  wildfires surrounding their hometown here in BC. They spent 3 weeks
  away from home and it was while they were evacuated that Michelle got
  the news that she is now ""active"" on the Transplant list.
  This means that BC Transplant is actively looking for a Donor Heart
  match for her and that they could get the call at anytime. Michelle will have to remain in Vancouver post-surgery in order to be
  monitored for symptoms of rejection and infection. She will not be
  able to be on her own in the weeks and months immediately following
  surgery and it is anticipated that she will have to remain in
  Vancouver for up to 12 months to participate in the rehabilitation process. I have always known Michelle to be kind and thoughtful and usually is
  happiest helping others or feeding people. She has a joyful and
  generous spirit and is beloved by many but especially friends and
  family. Will you help Michelle and Jamie and alleviate the pressure of
  this monumental journey they are about to go through? Even the
  smallest donation will help. Please donate today and help this very
  special person not have to worry and be focused on her recovery.",https://fundrazr.com/newheartformichelle

225,PLEASE HELP my son see Disney in FULL COLOR!,U.S. Dollar,"Oct 24, 2017",of $349 goal,6,"About us... We are a family of 6 on one
        income. I am a stay at home mom of 4 amazing kids. I have one
        daughter who is 17.  I have two middle sons, ages 14 and 13.
        They have autistic disorders but have come a LONG way with all
        the help and support of friends, family, teachers, coaches,
        therapist and God. Then we had Kyle.  Kyle is our first son who
        is ""normal"" and now I just found out he is moderate
        Protan color blind. Protan is one of the rarer type (1% of color
        blind people are protan).  What does that mean?  Well anything
        with red in it he doesn't see correctly. Purples look blue b/c the red portion of the color purple is
        missing. Red sometimes looks black . Orange and green can look
        like each other. Most stuff looks like a weird brownish green . His world is
        shades of brown/green with blue , yellow , black and white. It breaks my heart because I
        LOVE colors.  I love r a i n b o w s , and crystals and holiday decorations. I love
        fall leaves, flowers , fireworks and M & M's . How do these things
        look to him?  Probably dreary. Kyle is 8 years old and is in
        3rd grade. He LOVES riding his dirt bike , playing soccer,
        building things and helping his dad with what ever project he is
        working on. He is a dare devil and talks nonstop.  We suspected
        for years that he may be colorblind but we didn't understand the
        condition. So when we would do our little tests and ask him
        ""What color is this?"", if he got it right, we assumed
        he could see fine and must be playing a trick on us. Now I get
        it, and it's not that simple. He has learned what we call red and what we call orange.  He
        doesn't however see it like we do.  In fact they are all so
        close in color to him he has a hard time telling them apart at
        all. It all depends on the lighting and how far away the thing
        is. Color blindness runs in my
          family and on my husbands side as well, but we thought we were
          in the clear. Maybe in denial. After having some teachers
          voice their concerns, and the many times he called something
          the wrong color, we  finally just had him
        tested...twice.  I believe it now. It's effecting his school
        situations as well as his sports.  And I would assume,  just his
        everyday enjoyment of life. I know he doesn't know what he's
        missing, but I do. We take seeing in color for granted. Color
        brings joy to us though.  I have probably done all I can to help
        my older boys with their autism, I'd like to do what I can to
        help Kyle. This fundraiser is to raise
          money to buy Kyle a pair of glasses that will help him
        see the colors he's missing.  It helps 75% of people who try
        them.  We have been saving for a few years and we are finally
        taking our kids to Florida for a week in November of this year.
        Kyle's 9th birthday is during this week. We will be spending his
        whole birthday at Disney's Magic Kingdom! We are also going to
        Disney's Animal Kingdom, the ocean, and
          Universal Studio's islands of adventure.  I would LOVE for him
          to see Disney, Universal and the beach in all it's glory with a pair of these glasses. He will also get to see the

"4,675",Help Fund Nathan Zenarosa’s Jaw Surgery,Canadian Dollar,,of $5.1k goal,62,"I am hosting this fundraiser on behalf of my friend Ricard
    Zenarosa. This is his story: ""Nearly seventeen years ago, my son Nathan Zenarosa was
    born with a bilateral cleft lip and palate; and a hole in his heart. Thankfully when he was two years old the hole in his heart
    closed on its own, but the opening in his lip and palate prevented
    him from feeding/eating normally as he grew up. While we were still
    in the Philippines, he had to endure bullying and ridicule on a
    daily basis. He has had numerous operations to try to close the openings of
    his upper lip and palate, align his teeth so that they grow in the
    correct space and add bone grafts to the gaps in his gums. After all
    these surgeries, the opening in his palate continues to be an issue
    because it reopens as he grows older and bigger over the years. Nathan is scheduled for an operation on May 24 that will be a
    major step forward. It has the following procedures: Realignment of his upper jaw (maxillary) Realignment of his lower jaw (mandibular) Malar augmentation to offset realignment of the upper jaw Genioplasty to offset realignment of the lower jaw Closure of the opening of his palate The remarkable thing is that procedure 3 and 4 are considered
    cosmetic and are not covered under the Medical Services Plan (MSP),
    with an estimated cost of $7,000. While it is possible to not do
    these 2 steps, the idea that we would not do the best that we can
    for our son seems inconceivable. How could we subject him to this
    operation and then have the result compromised just because the
    expense is beyond our means? I am asking for your help in contributing to funding this
    portion of the upcoming operation and to spread the word about this
    campaign through your social network and contacts.  Any help would
    be greatly appreciated by Nathan and our whole family. Thanks you very much Richard Zenarosa"" Cleft lips and palates are the most common craniofacial
    malformations of newborns. It occurs when there is a failure of
    closure of the lips and bones of the palate. Serious feeding and
    airway problems occur and this leads to undernourishment and
    recurrent lung infections. Numerous surgical repair procedures are
    required to correct this problem.",https://fundrazr.com/81Evp8

    save Mom's life. She needs cancer-killing herbs, roots, oils, a raw
    foods diet, and we might even consider a trip to the States to a
    cancer clinic that has had a high success rate in treating people
    with cancer, plus we’re trying to get her moved back to B.C. so she can be
    near to family during this difficult time. The costs she faces are considerable, and unfortunately,
    alternative treatments aren’t recognized or covered under most
    health plans, and standard treatments also entail costs, both of
    which are looming on the horizon. Mom has grappled with health problems for years and suffers with
    pain each day, and yet in spite of this, she has reached out to help
    others heal emotionally. I’m praying that in her time of need, her friends and
    acquaintances will come to her aid. This would pave the way for her to get the treatments she needs
    to win this terrible battle she faces. ABOUT MY MOM From an early age, Mom shared a deep bond with animals. She
    traveled to the tropics and was captivated by the parrots there. In
    later years, she worked with abused parrots and rehabilitated them,
    teaching them to trust and love again. My mom has always been deeply touched by music and she is a
    talented guitarist and plays the piano. One of her favorite piano
    pieces is Clair de Lune by Debussy. She’s also an author and needs more time to finish and publish
    the books she was working on before she fell ill. She is my mother and a loving grandmother and we don't want her
    life cut short, nor have her torn away from us. One of her greatest
    wishes is to have more years to spend with us. LET’S HELP MAKE HER WISHES COME TRUE If you decide to donate to this fundraiser, any gift, whether
    large or small, will be deeply appreciated, and we thank you from
    the bottom of our hearts. Your actions may make a huge difference to

"3,595",Eli Howey's top surgery/studio clear-out fundraise,Canadian Dollar,"Nov 27, 2017",of $3.5k goal,70,"I got my date for top surgery a few days ago, thankfully its a lot
  sooner than it was initially planned. I'm very excited to get this
  done before next summer, I've been binding for 5 plus years and other
  than being a physical discomfort while biking, swimming, exercising,
  in change rooms, singing, during hot weather giving skin irritations
  etc...psychologically it is something I want to move on from as a part
  of my gender transition. After I'm healed i will be able to move
  around more easily and exist a lot more safely in public like at the
  gym, in locker rooms, while traveling, swimming and other normal stuff
  that are currently very stressful and not really avoidable. I don't feel comfortable just asking for help without providing
  something in return so I've added lots of 'perks' as this website
  calls them. I am an artist and printmaker so please take this
  opportunity to get some art, clothing or comics from me. This will
  also help clear out my studio and get me pumped to make some new work
  after my recovery. So I'm getting Periareolar (Keyhole mastectomy) and chest conturing
  which will cost $2260.00, the rest of the money is for medication,
  recovery time and shipping costs for clothes and posters. EDIT: i raised the goal because the paypal/fundrazr charges are
  actually a lot and i wont be able to afford shipping otherwise! sorry
  i didn't read all the things",https://fundrazr.com/elihowey-topsurgery
"2,335",For the Love of Ben Durst,U.S. Dollar,,of $36.9k goal,27,"For those of you who do not know Ben Durst personally, I am sorry.
  For those of you that do know Ben, I am still sorry. But you know
  why..... (lol) Ben hit a cold reality when he was recently diagnosed with bladder
  cancer. It was a shock to say the least. He is too young and not ready
  to stop making people laugh. He wants to fight.  But he has a problem..... Ben is on Medicare. He does not have prescription drug coverage. The
  one medication he has to take at home to build his white blood cells
  after the chemo kills them off is $4,752 a prescription. He has 7
  refills. That's $33,264 for this prescription for his 4 cycles of
  chemo, and the month after. If he does not get this medication, the
  chemo will surely kill him. This medication will help him fight off
  infection since his white blood cells will no longer have those
  capabilities. There are organizations that will help, and he is in
  communication with them.  However, they are slow to reply and he needs
  to be sure he has financing. He was able to get the first prescription free. Ben has always had 2 goals in life... The first goal is to laugh and
  make others laugh. He went to the hospital telling people he was
  worried about a certain test because he didn't get to study for it. Of
  course, everyone laughed. He loves having parties and getting family
  together. He is always there for his Mom Evelyn, and his sister Lisa.
  He takes care of me, the house and my parents. Ben is a big guy with
  an even bigger heart. His other goal is to work. He is a truck driver and loves being on
  the road. He makes overnight deliveries while seeing the country. An
  active member Fraternal Organization of Eagles #3138 (Taylor, MI), he
  has often stopped in clubs around his delivery locations just to
  support the organization. All he wants to do now is get back to work
  and feel whole again. I am Suzette Pariseau and I have been Ben's better half for more
  than 6 years.  I am an ESL teacher and can take time off work to help
  him, but I do not get paid for the time I take off. Financially, I
  have to take care of our regular bills to keep us afloat.  Ben is also
  a proud man and would never ask for monetary help, so I am doing it
  for him. If you can donate and help him pay for his medications, it
  would be greatly appreciated.  Any amount would help. If you need any
  more information than what I have already posted, or would prefer to
  send a donation via snail-mail, please email me at parisuze@yahoo.com , or Cancer2017SUCKS@yahoo.com . Thank you for your generosity. Everyone loves a comedian. Please help keep Ben Durst laughing....",https://fundrazr.com/helpBenDurst
135,Cannabis Therapeutics Certification,U.S. Dollar,,of $10k goal,7,"This year we are celebrating 15 years since the American
    Alliance for Medical Cannabis was founded. Dr. Jay Cavanaugh created
    AAMC to help patients and to educate health professionals, lawmakers
    and the general public about the therapeutic uses of Cannabis. We
    have come a long way since 2001. We now have AAMC Directors in 21
    States, and 26 States plus the District of Columbia have legal
    medical marijuana. The most common question patients ask is “Where can I find a
    doctor who can help me?” Most doctors have not had a chance to learn
    about medical cannabis. They didn’t learn about the endocannabinoid
    system in medical school and they are reluctant to talk about it. The American Alliance for Medical Cannabis is dedicated to
    helping patients. We need your support to increase our staff so that
    we can identify qualified health professionals and provide patients
    with quality medical care. By becoming AAMC certified clinics, health professionals will
    demonstrate that they are informed about the therapeutic use of
    Cannabis. AAMC is trusted by patients. We understand the needs of
    patients. Patients will know that they are being cared for by
    competent doctors. Patients have the right to talk about their use
    of Cannabis with people who know that it’s not just for fun. Our goal is to develop clinics where patients can get complete
    medical care from doctors who know how Cannabis helps. If you would
    like to help, please give AAMC a generous donation today. AAMC certified clinics provide: * Knowledgeable doctors and nurses * Cannabis is part of initial treatment plan when indicated. * Clinics are typical doctor's offices * Full service health care The goal is to develop clinics that have knowledgeable staff to
    deliver patient care.",https://fundrazr.com/MedicalCannabis

250,Adding Color to Mallory's Life,U.S. Dollar,,of $349 goal,6,"Christmas for Mallory... We all know her and love her. She's
      the crazy girl who decided to be an artist even though she's
      green/red color blind. This Christmas, I'd like to show Mallory
      just how loved she is with a pair of color-blind corrective
      glasses. If we can all pitch in together we can really show Mal
      how amazing her art is and show her the natural beauty she's been
      missing. Anything toward the final goal is a GREAT contribution. IN ADDITION to the glasses, I'd
      like to put together a small booklet of letters, quotes, poems,
      pieces or art, etc about color, beauty, love, art and more. Even
      if you cannot give money, I'd love to include you in this part of
      the gift. I think Mallory would really
      appreciate all of her friends and family thinking of her and
      giving her this gift. And trust me, there WILL be a video of her
      trying them on for the first time. THANK YOU in advance Now read their spiel all about

200,Help me get Enchroma glasses for Joel,U.S. Dollar,,of $350 goal,2,"I was out walking with Joel
      yesterday, admiring the beauty of the leaves changing. I pointed
      out how bright the red leaves that stood alone on a branch on a
      tree that the rest of the leaves were still green. He asked
      ""where?"" They were right in front of us and the stark
      contrast was incredible. He simply couldn't see it. It really
      motivated me to save up for those enchroma glasses for him. With
      him being color blind, he is unable to see the difference between
      the oranges reds and greens. The only color he was able to pick
      apart, was yellow. They all kind of blend together for him. I
      wanted to cry. He has been missing out on SO MUCH. The look on his
      face when he gets to see the colors will be worth the $400. I'm
      just hoping I can manage to get them before the leaves all turn brown. WHAT IS ENCHROMA? Over 300 million people worldwide are affected by red-green color

    in October and friends for 6 years. Michael has worked since he was
    14. He had a great work ethic and worked not only his full time job
    but side jobs. He was a mechanic and painter a nd
    his main career was for 30+years as a Manager and District Manager
    in the Grocery field. In September 2015 his life was changed forever. As he was
    closing at his new job for the night, two armed men came in and
    robbed the store. He was beaten for over 20 minutes against the safe
    and with the handgun. Michael has had both knees operated on due to
    being slammed to the floor numerous times. He now has black out
    seizures, some are in the brain and many of the seizures are Grand
    Mal. In April of this year I came home to find him in a continual
    seizure episode. He was hospitilized and in ICU. His hospital stay
    ran for a week and I lost income due to having to stay with him. His
    diagnosis is TBI, PTSD and 80% loss of hearing on his left side (we
    are awaiting surgery on that issue); he will never be able to work
    according to his Doctors and he is unable to drive so, we have to
    pay for his rides to therapy, Doctors visits etc. Our medical bills are mounting and there has been no place to
    go for needed items. We have applied for his SSD but they are in the
    hearing stage which can be another 18 months. We have monthly
    expenses for monitors to keep him safe, and the loss of his income
    has left us with no savings and behind on bills. We have filed for
    everything under the sun but we are still waiting, with no end in
    sight. Our needs are to pay his medical bills, maintain payment on
    his fall detection monitor, get him a new cane and pay for the
    numerous supplements that he has to take. If all bills get paid with
    this campaign, I'd also be exlploring hyperbaric treatment; studies
    have shown tremendous results with traumautic brain injury.We are
    optimistic with quality care and less stress that he will be able to
    maintain living safely in our home.",https://fundrazr.com/michaelmaberryshealthfund
296,Help me give the gift of color vision to my Boys,U.S. Dollar,"Nov 30, 2017",of $1.1k goal,8,"Their Story Hello Everyone, My name is Carrie and I have the
      pleasure of being a daughter and an Aunt to wonderful people. My
      father is in his 60s and has spent his entire life not being able
      to see all the colors in the rainbow. He has had carpenter jobs
      and has worked with cars, but has always had limitations. My
      father's art is truly amazing, but there is never colors. I want
      him to be able to add colors to his art and not have limitations.
      My two nephews will also spend a life without all the colors
      unless we can change that. The other day I pointed out a rainbow
      that was in the sky before I realized that they might not see it.
      The rainbow was faint appearing. My nephew must have stared in the
      sky for a good ten minutes trying to see it all. I want to give
      the gift of color vision to my family. Please contribute by
      donating and sharing their story. I hope to raise enough money to
      at least buy adult Enchroma glasses for my father to wear and the
      boys to try on, but it would be awesome if they all could have
      their own pair of glasses. Any amount helps and if you can not
